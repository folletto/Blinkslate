# Blinkslate simple & minimalist WordPress Theme

## Why?

Customisation for WordPress themes is often limited to a banner area, while anything else requires understanding CSS. Instead, I wanted something that could change completely look and feel, with a minimal set of changes.

How? It's a simple recipe:
* full page background
* CSS build in grayscale with just two coloured elements
* a separated CSS file for configuration


## How?

You just have to download and install this theme as you usually do, then open cfg/style.cfg.css and edit the few things inside the file.
You'll notice that you won't be able to change much, but with the right colour and a great background image you can completely change the look and feel of this simple theme. You will also be able to fake the appearance of more complex layouts, you just have to build the right image.
